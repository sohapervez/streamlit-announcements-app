# streamlit-announcements-app
This app was created as a solution to a task assignment.

The assignment is saved as 'assignment.txt' in the repository.

The API has some protection due to which it doesn't give json data using the 'requests' library. Therefore, for this task's sake, the data from all 5 TICKERs has been saved manually in json format (using an online json formatted) with a .txt extension and saved in the same folder of the project.

The Streamlit app has been created by working through these .txt files.
