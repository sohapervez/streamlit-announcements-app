Test Assignment 

You are provided with an API URL:

https://www.asx.com.au/asx/1/company/{TICKER}/announcements?count=20&market_sensitive=false
where {TICKER} represents a company ticker symbol.

You are also given a list of ticker symbols:
AEE
REZ
1AE
1MC
NRZ

Tasks:

1- Retrieve the 20 most recent announcements for each ticker in the list.
2- Display all the retrieved information in a Streamlit application. The app can be 1 page with minimal styling, only working functionality matters. 
3- Implement a functionality that allows users to filter and view announcements by selecting the ticker symbol.
4- Implement a functionality to identify and display tickers that have a "Trading Halt" announcement in their recent announcements.

Submission:

Submit your solution as two links:

A link to the GitHub repository containing all the source code.
A link to the deployed Streamlit app demonstrating the solution.
